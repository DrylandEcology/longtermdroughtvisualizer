Steps taken to manually get S3 .sql files to function with long term drought simulator (from session terminal):
	
	1) Navigate to home/devel/
	2) Download database files: aws s3 sync s3://sbsc-upload-data .
		
Note: If you run into permissions issues with navigating to that directory you can replace the . at the end of 2 with the path in 1.

After running these commands you should be able to run the app from the devel account on the RStudio server without any errors related to the databases.
